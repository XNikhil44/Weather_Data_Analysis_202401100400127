# Weather Data Analysis â€“ Visualize temperature trends, rainfall, and seasonal patterns from a small weather dataset

Weather Data Analysis Project
This repository holds a Python-based project for weather data analysis and visualization, with a focus on temperature trends, rainfall patterns, and seasonal changes.
Project Overview
The project shows data analysis and visualization methods on a synthetic weather dataset, including five primary visualizations:

Temperature trends over time
Monthly rainfall distribution
Seasonal weather patterns
Temperature-rainfall relationship
Monthly weather metrics heatmap

Repository Contents

Weather_Data_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook holding the entire code
Weather_Data_Analysis_Report.pdf: In-depth report of the project
weather_data.csv: Synthetic weather dataset

Requirements
The project needs the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

Install these requirements by:
Copypip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Usage

Clone this repository
